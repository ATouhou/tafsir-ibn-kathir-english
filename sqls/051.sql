<span class="taf-ref-3 taf-tr taf-tr-qur">They used to sleep but little at night.</span> The scholars of Tafsir have two opinions about this:
<br/>
<span class="taf-head">The First Opinion</span>
The first is that, they used to spend a little part of every night awake.

<br/>
<span class="taf-head">The Second Opinion</span>
They used to spend a little part of the night in sleep. This was preferred by Ibn Jarir. Al-Hasan Al Basri said:
<span class="taf-ref-3 taf-arb taf-qur">(۱۷) كانوا قليلا من الليل ما يهجعون</span>
<span class="taf-ref-3 taf-tr taf-tr-qur">They used to sleep but little at night.</span> "They performed voluntary night prayer and would not sleep during the night except a little.

Instead he invited them using a kind and subtle invitation,
<span class="taf-ref-3 taf-arb taf-qur">ألا تأكلون</span>
<span class="taf-ref-3 taf-tr taf-tr-qur">Will you not eat?</span> This statement is similar to one of us saying to a guest, "Would you be kind and generous to do such and such?"
