<br>Some scholars said that <span class="taf-tri">Al-Jariyat Yusra</span> refers to the stars that float in their orbits with ease. This would mean that the things mentioned were ascendant in their order, beginning with the lower, then mentioning the higher one after that, etc. The winds being the clouds, the stars are above them and the angels who distribute by Allah\'s order are above that, and they descend with Allah\'s legislative orders and the decrees He determines.

All of these sayings return to the same meaning, that of beauty and complexity. The sky is high above us, clear yet think, firmly structured, spacious and graceful, beautified with stars such as the sun and orbiting planets such as the moon and the planets of the solar system.

<span class="taf-ref-3 taf-tr taf-tr-qur">They used to sleep but little at night.</span> The scholars of Tafsir have two opinions about this:
<br/>
<span class="taf-head">The First Opinion</span>
The first is that, they used to spend a little part of every night awake. Ibn `Abbas said, "Every night, they would worship Allah, even during a little part of the night."<span class="taf-foot"><span class="t">At-Tabari 22:407 </span></span> Qatadah narrated that Mutarrif bin `Abdullah said, "Hardly a night would pass by them that they did not pray to Allah the Exalted and Most Honored, either in the beginning, or the middle of it."<span class="taf-foot"><span class="t">At-Tabari 22:407</span></span> Mujahid said, "Only a few nights, if any, would they sleep through the night until the morning without praying Tahajjud."<span class="taf-foot"><span class="t">At-Tabari 22:408</span></span> Qatadah said similarly.<span class="taf-foot"><span class="t">At-Tabari 22:408</span></span> Anas bin Malik and Abu Al-`Aliyah said, "They used to pray between Al-Maghrib and Al-`Isha`."<span class="taf-foot"><span class="t">At-Tabari 22:407-408</span></span> 
<br/>
<span class="taf-head">The Second Opinion</span>
They used to spend a little part of the night in sleep. This was preferred by Ibn Jarir. Al-Hasan Al Basri said:
<span class="taf-ref-3 taf-arb taf-qur">(۱۷) كانوا قليلا من الليل ما يهجعون</span>
<span class="taf-ref-3 taf-tr taf-tr-qur">They used to sleep but little at night.</span> "They performed voluntary night prayer and would not sleep during the night except a little. They were active and would continue until they were seeking forgiveness right before dawn"<span class="taf-foot"><span class="t">At-Tabari 22:408-409</span></span>

`Abdullah bin Salam said, "When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ arrived at Al-Madinah, people quickly gathered around him and I was among them. When I saw his face, I knew that it was not the face of a liar. The first statement I heard from him was,

Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, 
<span class="taf-ref-3 taf-tr taf-tr-had">For those who use soft speech, feed food and spend the night in voluntary prayer while people are asleep</span><span class="taf-foot"><span class="t">Ahmed 2:173</span></span>

<span class="taf-ref-3 taf-tr taf-tr-had">Allah, the Most High, descends each night to the lowest heaven when the last third of the night remains. He says, "Is there anyone who is repending so that I may accept his repentance? Is there anyone seeking forgiveness, so that I may forgive him? Is there anyone asking of Me, so that I may grant him his request?" until Fajr begins.</span><span class="taf-foot"><span class="t">Fath Al-Bari 3:35, 11:133 and 13:473<br/>Muslim 1:521 and 523<br/>Abu Dawud 2:77 and 5:101<br/>Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi 9:471<br/>An-Nasa\'i in Al-Kubra 4:24<br/>Ibn Majah 1:435</span></span>
